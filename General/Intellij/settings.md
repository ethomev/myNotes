### chaining method calls ###
chained method calls, each on a new line.
File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style -> Java -> Wrapping & Braces -> Chained Method Calls click behaviour, I think the default is "Do not wrap" and change it to "wrap always"
Also, select "wrap first call" & align when multiline.
