## what is design thinking

Mindset / Problem solving approach that aims to improve the situation of people through the experiences they have.
When designing something expand your thinking to the surroundings of it, the people, ...

How an idea helps a person achieve a task instead of focusing on building the idea.

Focus on the human experience
  Focus on real people and real needs
  interact with those people, to find out the problems they face.
  Come up with ideas to solve those problems
  Be visual in thinking & brainstorming
  experiment

A Mindset anyone can apply

## enterprise design thinking

enterprise is a different beast to traditional/small projects

a tailor-made approach for large, distributed teams to help them quickly deliver human-centered outcomes to the market

### Principles

guide your daily work, keep your user in mind, collaborate with diverse teams, continuously improve

#### focus on customer outcomes, help users achieve their goals

who are our users?
what is their current experience?
how could it be improved?

Identify the user problems which underlie the business problems
ask why, *5 whys*

you are not your users!

build empathy for users

#### diverse empowered teams

break the silo
The value of diverse perspectives become even greater as your problem space gets more complex.
diverge to individual brainstorming first
  push past the obvious ideas
visual cluster by basic commonality
review clustered ideas, build on them
converge on a shared idea and decide what to do next
diversity can also bring misunderstanding & conflict
  the team need to be aligned

1. if things are going around in circles, ask everyone to grab something to write with, visualize their thoughts, and then take turns sharing.
2. if only one or two people are sharing opinions, hold a silent and anonymous voting session to expose everyone's view point.
3. when someone is talking, no one else should be talking. Call it out when it happens.

#### restless reinvention, treat everything as a prototype / work in progress

active continuous testing and learning in order to improve the solution to a problem
ask why
shifting from waiting until it's perfect to until it's ready
enables more regular delivery of value to users
Visualize your ideas, as low tech as a drawing on a piece of paper
iterate on the idea
brainstorming, quantity over quality.
  get the obvious ones out of the way first and let your creative juices flow.
  any absurd idea gets put on a page.
  "ideating" the practice of coming up with new ideas.
    practice makes perfect
  change the constraints/context of your situation/problem
    throw in something absurd completely outside the constraints/context.
Take risks
  don't be afraid to fail.
  From failure comes learning
prototype


### The loop

An infinite loop, understand the present and envision the future in a continuous cycle.

Observe -> Reflect -> Make

#### Observe

Interview users
watch the work
test your ideas with the people who matter most to inform your decision-making & understanding

#### Reflect

come together and look within to synchronize your movements
synthesize what you've learned and share your aha moments

#### Make

give concrete form to abstract ideas.
the earlier you make the faster you learn.
Get prototypes out there for feedback

### Keys

#### Hills

Align your team around the meaningful outcomes you want to achieve.

Hills are statements of intent written as user enablements.
  Who - your user
  What - what will your user be able to do that they couldn't before
  Wow - what differentiates you from the competition
One team in IBM do 3 hills per Q

Problem statements are often the seed of hills.

A formula:

Our users *struggle to* achieve some task today *because of* blockers, ....

focus on the need, stay solution agnostic
gather information to iterate on the problem statement

### Playback

Stay aligned by regularly exchanging feedback.
Story based ppts that share insights, ideas and updates
tell memorable, human centered stories that share ideas, prototypes, strategies and more.
build playbacks into your workflow
  1. starting a new project/inititiave
    who will be the users & stakeholders
    what experience are we trying to improve & why
  2. deciding as a team on a future experience for your users.
    what do we think our users need to be successful
    how are we going to serve those needs.
  3. reviewing progress as you deliver.
    do we successfully deliver value to our users
    are we still aligned as a team
share ideas early, in a casual environment
anchor it in user needs
  rubber ducking!


### Sponsor users

Invite users into the work.
Sponsor users are external clients, end users, ... that represent your target user who regularly contribute domain expertize to your team.
confidentiality agreements


## tomorrow

Refocus my work as a user-centered problem
  problem statements
    what problem are you solving, for whom and why
    [our users] struggle to [achieve some task] because of [blockers]
  needs statements
    [our users] need a way to [addresses this need] so that they [benefit in this way]
