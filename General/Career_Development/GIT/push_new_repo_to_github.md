###### push new repo to github ######
Created Thursday 27 July 2017

if you've been working on a repo for a while and want to push it up to github.

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

There's no command to auto create the repo from your local command line,
you need to create it on github first, and configure your local repo to push to it
