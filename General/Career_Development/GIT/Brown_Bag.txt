==== Slide 1 ====
This is my git, there are many other like it, but this one is mine
Any full metal jacket fans????

==== Slide 2 ====
First and foremost, what version of git are you on? git --version
I would advise to check and update, the latest is 2.14.1
There was a release in the last 6 months which had a 30% improvement in performance!
I cloned the repo and build from there every month.

==== Slide 3 ====
Overview of user config
loads of possible configurations, I haven't gotten through half of them yet.

==== Slide 4 ====
Don't you just hate it when you pull down a repo and there's no gitignore file
	loads of crap in the repo
	you have to go find a gitignore file and commit it to the repo
	Not anymore!!!!
gitignore
	global gitignore file
	

==== Slide 5 ====
shorten git commands to meaningless words :-) abbreviations


==== Slide 6 ====
bash functions in aliases
use ther review alias to describe it
! means what's in the alias will be treated as a shell command

==== Slide 7 ====
For the linux heads :-D
bashrc git stuff
	git repo has a folder contrib/completion
		add these files to your path
	1. auto complete anything within a git command
	2. update the prompt when you go into a git repo

==== Slide 8 ====
hooks
	describe the ones I think would be most useful
	but I haven't any written yet.
	uses:
		commit-msg, auto populate JIRA title from ID


==== Slide 9 ====
Jump utility
I forget where I found it but it's a handy little utility
mark a directory
then you can jump to it from anywhere in the file system

==== Slide 10 ====
vimtutor
