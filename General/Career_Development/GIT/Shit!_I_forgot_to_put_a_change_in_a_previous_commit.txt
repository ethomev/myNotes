====== Shit! I forgot to put a change in a previous commit ======
Created Tuesday 22 August 2017

**N.B. This is only if the commits aren't on origin master**

git add <file>
	add the file/change to be tracked
git commit --fixup HEAD~1 
	This gives the commit the same subject line as the commit at HEAD~1 **prepended with "fixup!"**
	This commit is temporary as it will be squashed up into the commit you want to add to
git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~<index_of_commit>
	this command orders the rebase ofcommits
	the commit at HEAD~<index_of_commit> is first
	followed by any commits which start with squash! or fixup!, ...
save and exit the editor

--autosquash can be set to true in the gitconfig file!!!!
