# Signals

Signals are used to emit notifications for processes to take action about asynchronous events / exceptions.
between processes (which is really from the user process to the kernel which sends it to another process) or from the kernel to user process.
Inter process communication
signals can only be sent between processes owned by the same user or from a process owned by the super user to any process.

commands are kill, killall & pkill
    not all signals result in the death of a process though

a process can take in a signal and handle it or just respond according to system defaults.

2 signals can't be handled and will always terminate the process:
    SIGKILL 9
    SIGSTOP 19

There are a number of different types of signals which signify different events / exceptions
Generally, signals are used to handle two things:
    exceptions detected by hardware
    exceptions generated by the environment

kill -L to list all signals:

âž¤ kill -L
 1 HUP      hangup detected
 2 INT      interrupt from keyboard
 3 QUIT     quit from keyboard
 4 ILL      illegal instruction
 5 TRAP     Trace/breakpoint trap for debugging
 6 ABRT     abnormal termination
 7 BUS      bus error
 8 FPE      floating point exception
 9 KILL     Kill signal
 10 USR1    user defined signal-1
 11 SEGV    invalid memory reference
 12 USR2    user defined signal-2
 13 PIPE    broken pipe
 14 ALRM    timer signal from alarm
15 TERM     process termination
16 STKFLT   stack fault on math processor
17 CHLD     child stopped or terminated
18 CONT     continue if stopped
19 STOP     stop process
20 TSTP     stop types at tty
21 TTIN     background process required tty input
22 TTOU     background process required tty output
23 URG      urgent condition on socket
24 XCPU     CPU time limit exceeded
25 XFSZ     file size limite exceeded
26 VTALRM   virtual alarm clock
27 PROF     profile alarm clock
28 WINCH    window resize signal
29 POLL     i/o now possible
30 PWR      power failure
31 SYS      bad system called

A user process can't send a kill call directly to another process
it must ask the kernel to send the signal by executing a system call.

## commands

### kill

kill [<signal>] <pid>
if a signal is not given it defaults to SIGTERM 15
This means the process can take action to clean up after itself before it dies
SIGKILL 9 will make it die immediately

### killall

kill all commands by command name
same structure as kill, just name instead of pid

### pkill

kill all commands which match a selection criteria
