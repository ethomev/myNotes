====== Find ======
Created Tuesday 29 April 2014

Find files that contain a certain content:
	 find -type f | xargs grep -l "cron"
	
	**Much simpler one!!!!**
	grep -rl MeContext
	
Find files of a certain name/extension
	find . -name groovy-all*


**ACK-GREP**
Use this anymore for searching file content.
Ignores scm configuration folders and the output is nice and colourful.

ack-grep "cron"
