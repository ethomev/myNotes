c# java command line tools

## jconsole

monitor a running jvm process

threads, memory, classes, mbeans

### mbeans

you can do a lot with mbeans
for example, take a dump of the running threads and heap

## jhat

analyse the heap of a dump

parses the dump file and starts a web server.

### OQL

Object Query Language, similar to SQL but on objects in the heap

examples: find all the class of a certain type.

I'm sure there's more complex stuff that could be done.
Like returning all the maps which contain a certain value???
