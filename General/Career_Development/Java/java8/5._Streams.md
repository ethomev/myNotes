# 5. Streams

##### What is a stream #####
A sequence of objects from a source, which supports aggregate operations (think SQL, min, max, count, avg)

##### Characteristics #####
Sequence of elements
	set of element of a specific type in sequential manner
	gets/computes elements on demand
	never stores
Source
	Collections, Arrays, IO resources
Aggregate operations
	filter, map, limit, find, ...
Pipelining
	a stream generally returns a stream so it can be piped into another stream
	collect() is terminal operation, generally at a end of a series of stream chained method calls
automatic iterations
	streams iterate over the sequence of elements automatically
Original collection is untouched
	FP Paradigm again
Streams are either intermediate or terminal
	intermediate: pass the stream on
	terminal: return void / a single object (a new collection, boolean, String, ...)

a chain of stream operations is called an operation pipeline

most stream operations apply a lambda expression to each element
	non-interfering
		don't update the collection coming into the stream.
		FP no side affects
	stateless
		don't depend on any variable / state from the outer scope


##### Generating Streams #####
List & Set interfaces have 2 methods to generate a stream
stream
parallelStream

Can also create a stream using Stream.of(vararg of objects)

IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream are API's for creating number type specific streams and specific methods on them

##### Methods of a stream #####

forEach
	iterate over each element
map
	apply a lambda expression to each element
	"map" it to its corresponding result
filter
	filter the elements based on a criteria (Predicate)
	Intermediate operation
limit
	the number of elements iterated over
sorted
	sorts the stream based on the comparator of the type
match
	any/all/none
	takes a lambda / Predicate which returns a boolean
count
	terminal operation to count the elements left in the stream.
reduce
	terminal operation to reduce all elements into a single object based on a lambda


##### Collectors #####
parameters to collect method to decide how to "collect" results

##### Statistics #####
summaryStatistics API

##### Maps #####
Maps don't support streams
They do support various new and useful methods for doing common tasks

* putIfAbsent
* forEach (accepts a consumer to be applied to each KV pair)
* computeIfPresent
* get
* containsKey
* computeIfAbsent
* remove (but only if the key has a certain value)
* getOrDefault
* merge (takes a key, value and function) if no key put in the value, if present merge it using the function

##### Processing Order #####

Streams are lazy, intermediate operations are only executed if a terminal operation is present

Each element is processed by every operation before the next element is started. An element passes through the stream from start to finish before the next element is started.
	This can reduce the number of operations performed.
	For example if there is any matching operations the stream stops once the first one is found
	**For most operations!**
		sorted is stateful so it is called with all combinations of elements before the next operation is called.

Paying attention to ordering can reduce the number of operations
	Filter early. Call methods that reduce the number of elements early
	
Streams can't be reused
	once to call a terminal operation the stream is closed, exception thrown
	Can create a Steram supplier and call get to supply a new stream each time
	
##### Advanced Operations #####

#### collect ####
transform the elements of the stream into a different kind of results, e.g. different type / combing all elements into one
accepts a Collector, which consists of 4 different operations: supplier(creation of a new result container), accumulator(incorporating a new data element into a result container), combiner(combing 2 result containrts into one), finisher(performing an optional final transform on the container).
Built in Collectors provided via Collectors API, extensive API with very useful methods! 
	**Always check here before performing any opertions on a list!!!!**
	API includes a lot of aggregate functions (like SQL) for operating on ints
	Collectors API also contains Summarizing methods which return Summary objects to get multiple stats!
Create your own Collector using Collector.of(...)
	Generic type with 3 parameterized types: type of input elements, typed supplied by supplier and the output type
	
#### flatMap ####
transform each element of a stream into a stream of other objects.
Each object will be transform,ed into zero, one or multiple objects backed by streams.
