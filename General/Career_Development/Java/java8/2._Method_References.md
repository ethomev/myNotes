###### 2. Method References ######
Created Monday 03 October 2016

Help to point to methods by their names

syntax: ::

can point to static, instance and constructor methods

System.out.println()

System.out::println 

names.forEach(System.out::println);

System.out::println is a static method reference here.
The element in names is passed to it each time.

Same rules as normal apply for calling methods.
Can't call non-static from static, ...

##### Intermediate use #####
Method references can be used to glue classes together

Example: Bean and Factory classes.
PersonFactory<Person> personFactory # Person::new; (This shows up as a lambda expression in IDE)
Person person # personFactory.create("Peter", "Parker");

No need for a factory implementation! Everything is glued together via constructor references
