# 6. Optional Class

A container object which is used to contain non-null objects
Represents null with absent value.

Instead of returning the object and checking if it is null, return the optional and check is there a null present.
Reduces chances of NullPointerExceptions
Similar to Guava Optional, I presume this is where it came from.

Optional should only be used in return parameters, never use an optional as an input parameter or a field of a class.
This would signal that the method/class is doing too much
