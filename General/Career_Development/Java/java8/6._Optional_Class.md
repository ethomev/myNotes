# 6. Optional Class

A container object which is used to contain non-null objects
Represents null with absent value.

Instead of returning the object and checking if it is null, return the optional and check is there a null present.
Reduces chances of NullPointerExceptions
Similar to Guava Optional, I presume this is where it came from.

Optional should only be used in return parameters, never use an optional as an input parameter or a field of a class.
This would signal that the method/class is doing too much

There are some nice methods on the API

or()
  return a different optional using a Supplier
orElse()
  return a default value
orElseThrow()
  if the value is not present, throw an exception.
  2 overloaded methods,
    one takes a supplier which returns an exception
    the other takes no arguments and throws a NoSuchElementException
ifPresentOrElse()
  if the optional is present do something with it in the consumer argument
  or else carry out a default action in the runnable argument
