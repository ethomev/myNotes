====== 8. New Date Time API ======
Created Tuesday 04 October 2016

Drawbacks of old:
	not thread safe
		new is immutable and no setters
	Poor Design
	Difficult time zone handling

API's:
	java.time.Local	no complexity of time zone handling
	java.time.Zoned
	
Zones are represented by ZoneId, static accessor
	
ChronoUnit replaces TimeUnit

2 new classes for dealing with time differences
	Period:	date based amount of time
	Duration:	time based amount of time
	
another new class: Temporal Adjusters
	Perform Date Maths. "Next Tuesday" / Third Thursday of the month

	pass it to the with method of a date to create a new Date object

Backward compatibility
	ofInstant added to old API to return instance of new Class

Clock API provides access to the current date and time.
	instead of System.currentTimeInMillis
	can be zoned and default
	create Instant from Clock, toString gives date and time
	
DatetimeFormatter API available for easy creation of times (factory)
