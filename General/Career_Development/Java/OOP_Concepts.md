# OOP Concepts

## Polymorphism

Literal translation is to take many forms.
Many different things to be treated the same.
a thing to be treated like many things

All objects in java are polymorphic as they extend Object, so they can be treated as two things
	an Object or an instance of itself.

2 types of polymorphism.

### static

method overloading is static polymorphism

### dynamic

Objects at runtime and how they are treated is dynamic polymorphism
method overriding!
