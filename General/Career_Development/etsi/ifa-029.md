K8s & Helm are mentioned.
Although Apaches Mesos & Marathon are mentioned too

## Concepts

VNF Common Service, good idea in theory but the realization gets tricky with Helm.
Helm deploys everything in the chart, it has no idea of available common services.
Backing services (database, message bus) from the 12 factor app or monitoring service.
The VNFD describes what VNF Common Services are required, so it could be left out of the helm chart.
  The chart would probably still need values to connect to the common service
They talk about a Common VNF Services Manager to manage the common services
  they'll probably try and lump that under VNFM :-)
