container file using the zip file format
A container file is an archive file which contains multiple files of possibly different file types

Structure complies with TOSCA Simple Profile YAML v1.1

includes:

* service template of a cloud app
* all artifacts required to manage the lifecycle of the corresponding cloud app
* all artifacts to execute the cloud app

must contain:

/Meta-Inf
* MANIFEST.MF
    metadata of the other files in the csar
    in the form of k/v pairs

VNF Package contains:

* VNFD (descriptor)
* * defines VNF properties and requirements, such as
* * * Resources needed
* * * Connectivity
* * * LCM Behaviour
* * * References to sw images and other artifacts
* * * Affinity and anti-affinity policy rules
* * * Deployment flavours
* software images
* Manifest file
* additional files

VNF Package is a CSAR.
The structure and format of a VNF package shall conform to the TOSCA Simple Profile YAML v1.1 spec for CSAR format
VNFD is the main TOSCA definitions YAML file inside the archive

There are 2 Directory structure options

### Option 1 (Which is the option we will be using)

Called A1

/TOSCA-metadata
| - TOSCA.meta (This has entries pointing to all the files below)
/Definitions
| - MRF.yaml
| - otherTemplates
    | - ...
/Files
| - ChangeLog.txt
| - MRF.cert
| - /images
    | - ...
| - other artifacts
| - /Tests
    | - ...
| - /Licenses
    | - ...
/Scripts
| - ...
/MRF.mf

Depending on the CSAR Version in the TOSCA.meta file the individual files in the container do / don't have to be Referencd.

1.0 The TOSCA.meta file must contain explicit references to all the files in the container
1.1 The TOSCA.meta file need not contain explicit references, the TOSCA VNFD file can contain relative references

**And we are using version 1.1**

### Option 2

called A2

/MRF.yaml
/MRF.mf
/MRF.cert
/ChangeLog.txt
/Tests
| - ...
/Licenses
| - ...
/Artifacts
| - scripts
| - images
| - templates
| - ...

**A lot about ensuring integrity and authenticity of packages.**

It can be handled in one of two ways.

* Individual files can have digests provided which you can compare against.
  * The digests are located in the manifest file
    * path to file, algorithm and generated digest
* the complete csar file is digitally signed by the VNF provider
