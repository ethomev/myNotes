All about the contents of the VNF & NSD descriptor files
/
Specifies a data model for NFV descriptors, using the TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML (version 1.2)
**Also specifies requirements on the VNFM & NFVO specific to the handling of NFV descriptors**

TOSCA - Topology & Orchestration Specifiction for Cloud Applications
Is a modelling language for describing the components of a cloud application and their relationships.

Deployment Templates in NFV fully describe the attributes and requirements necessary to instantiate Network Services / Virtual Network Functions and manage their lifecycle.
A deployment template is made up of one or more TOSCA service templates

Two main deployment templates:

* VNFD
* NSD

*I'm only concerned with VNFD at the minute.*

VNFD is part of the VNF package. That's why we are concerned with it.
Also it's what is used by the VNFM to deploy and manage the lifecycle of the VNF instance.
The descriptor itself can contain VNF specific life cycle operations for the VNFM to carry out.

A VNFD contains the following main pieces of info:

* VDU - Virtualization Deployment Unit
  * description of the deployment and operational behaiviour of the VNF Component, VNFC
  * This maps to a single virtualization container, i.e. a VM
  * describes resources needed to deploy and lifecycle manager the VNFC
* CPD - Connection Point Descriptors
* VLD - Virtual Link Descriptor

## tosca.interfaces.nfv.vnflcm

contains a set of TOSCA operations corresponding to the following VNF LCM operations:

* instantiate
* terminate
* modify VNF information
* change VNF flavour
* change external VNF Connectivity
* operate VNF
* heal VNF
* scale VNF
* scale VNF to level

also talks about pre/postambles for each operation

If the operation is specified but left blank in the VNFD then it defaults to the operation provided by the VNFM
*Fingers crossed that's the way it'll go for us. Our work flows are meant to be generic*
