# conditionals

if, elif, else

syntax: if condition:
		first line of block indented 4 spaces, this is the convention, you can use 2/3/5 but the standard is 4
		else:

use == for equality check
use in to check for existence of a value in a list

you can use not in place of !
you can use the words 'and' and 'or' for boolean algebra

when using 'and' / 'or' python doesn't return a boolean, it returns the value which determined the result

python supports ternary statements
syntax is different though!

```python
"bigger" if a > b else "smaller"
```

python has the truthy/falsey concept, just like javascript

number other than zero is true
non empty string is true
non empty list is true
