# functional programming

## lambda functions

anonymous functions, same as I've seen in other languages

```python
power = lambda x: x * 2

sorted(names, lambda a,b: len(a) - len(b) or cmp(a,b))
```

x is the value to pass in
x * 2 is the operation

called just like a normal function

higher order functions
