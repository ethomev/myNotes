###### 6. Orchestration ######
Created Monday 16 January 2017

Template driven engine that allows application developers to describe and automate the deployment of infrastructure

Product in open stack is Heat.

#### Orchestration V CM ####

Orchestration is a sub-category of automation.
concerned with coordination of multiple components:
	servers, networks, volumes, ...
"Higher form" of automation
not just simple or lower level tasks but multi layer applications

CM is automation of server configuration.
typically declarative model based on fact discovery
abstracts out the underlying imple detail of service deployment

**Both are needed to fully automate cloud application deployment**


#### Languages ####

Heat natively supports HOT (Heat Orchestration Template) and AWS CFN
other languages can be translated into HOT using a translator

#### Capabilities ####

Describes the infrastructure for a cloud application, stack (deployment)
	openstack resources: servers, networks, volumes, ...
	Relationships between resources: this volume is connected to this server
	In a text file 
Manages that infrastructure
	Automatically changes the infrastructure when the template is modified and re-applied
	deletes infrastructure
Integrates with CM tools like puppet & chef
Provides an autoscaling service that integrates with Ceilometer

#### Heat API ####

heat-api, main rest api
heat-api-cfn, provides aws query api
both commuicate with heat-engine via MQ, tell it what actions to perform

#### Heat Engine ####

Does all the orchestration work
layer where resource integration is impl
contains abstractions to use auto sclaing and HA

#### Heat Cloudwatch API ####

Ideologically refers to AWS cloudwatch service
	gets metrics from stacks
is replaced by ceilometer

##### Heat Orchestration Template #####

Stacks are created from templates.
HOT is an orch doc that details everything that is needed to carry out an orch
Sam structure and abstractions as AWS CFN

YAML format, JSON also supported.
YAML used by Ericsson
	indentation like Python
	3 basic primitives:
		mappings (hashes, dictionaries)
		sequences (arrays, lists)
		scalars (strings, numbers)


#### Definitions ####

Parameters
	user defined params passed into template
Resources
	resources for heat to orchestrate
Outputs
	pretty self explanatory


#### Example basic file: ####

heat_template_version: 2013-05-23 (mandatory)
description: ..vfni fno[bv bn (optional)
resources:
	my_instance:
		type: OS::Nova::Server
		parameters:
			key_name:
			...

parameters
	
	<param_name>:
		type
		label
		description
		default
		hidden
		constraints:

constraints
	length
	range
	allowed_values
	allowed_patterns
	
Specify parameters to be used in resources

parameters:
	**server_name:** 
		typre: string
		....
		
resources:
	my_instance:
		type: OS::Nova::Server
		properties:
			name: { get_param: **server_name**}
			
**Syntax of resource type: OS::Component::Type**
Example: OS::Neutron::Port
	
outputs:
	instance_ip:
		description:
		value: {get_attr: [...]}


### Autoscaling with Heat ###

Heat + Ceilometer # Autoscaling
Ceilometer can send alarms about breaches of thresholds, for example.
Up & Down scale
Core functionality in Heat Engine

Resource types:
	OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup
		scale arbitrary resources
	OS::Heat::ScalingPolicy
		manage sclaing of group
	OS::Ceilometer::Alarm
		define ceilometer alarm
	OS::stack_id
		identifier to tie Alarm to AutoScalingGroup


### Customizing guest vm ###

3 broad methods for server configuration:
1. custom image building
2. use-data boot scripts and cloud-init
3. software deployment resources

Advantages of custom image building
1. Boot speed - no need for external downloads
2. Boot reliability
3. Test verification
4. No config dependencies

### User-data and cloud-init ###

## Nova User data ##

specical key in metadata service that holds user data provided at run time

cloud-init system retrieves user-data from metadata service and takes some action based on the content.

typical use case is to pass a shell script or config file

## cloud-init ##

open-source package from Ubuntu
industry standard for bootstrapping cloud servers

configure:
1. default locale
2. hostname
3. resizing boot disk to that specified in boot flavour
4. ssk keys
5. setting up ephemeral mount pointd

plenty of supported formats 

## Using user-data in heat ##

	properties

		user_data_format: RAW
		user_data:
		str_replace:

				<multi line bash>


#### Server Synchronization ####

OS::Heat::WaitCondition
	create sync wait point, to be handled by cm script
OS::Heat::WaitConditionHandle
	signal condition completion
	

##### Software Deployment Resources #####

Short comings of cloud-init/user-data
	difficult to manage large embedded scripts
	can only run script at stack create/update
	difficult to describe/code complex deployments with many dependencies

OS::Heat::SoftwareConfig
	create a reference to an immutable CM script,
	optionally parameterized with input values
	stored in heat db
OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment
	associate softwareconfig to a server
	allows input values to be defined and passed to config
	after script completion output is avaialable as this resources attributes
	can be triggered on stack create, update, suspend, resume, delete
	some tools are required on the glance image:
		os-collect-config, os-refresh-config
		heat-config, heat-config-hook, ...
	Multiple instances can be ordered and have dependencies
