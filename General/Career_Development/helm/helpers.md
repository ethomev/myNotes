# helpers.tpl

https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/

uses Go Templates: https://godoc.org/text/template

adds include and required.

## what's the difference between template and include?

I think what you can do with the output

template can only be used once
but include can pass the output to another template
