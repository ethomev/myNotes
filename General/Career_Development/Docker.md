# Docker

Docker started as an API that isolates processes

Project to create, ship and deploy images in a light weight container (stripped back to basics linux OS)
	Docker engine
		create and run
	Docker Hub
		share
		
Expanding to tools to manage containers
	Tutum - manage containers on public clouds, AWS, digital ocean
	Docker Universal Control Plane - manage containers in a private cloud on premise (Inside Ericsson)
	Both are in beta
	
	Docker Compose - Simply create multi container deployments
	Docker Swarm - cluster docker containers into one manageable interface.

the kernel version of a docker image must be compatible with the kernel version running on the host machine
