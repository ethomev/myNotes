###### DNS ######
Created Friday 15 January 2016

Good analogy:
	 The DNS nodenames are like the names of people you call, the IP addresses are like their phone numbers. DNS is like an online telephone book that looks up the “phone number” (IP address) for “people” (nodes) you want to “call” (connect to). 

DNS will return both addresses
	Where possible applications will use the ipv6 address.
