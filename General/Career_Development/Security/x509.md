# x509

Is a standard in cryptography which defines the format of public key certificates.
Used in TLS/SSL, i.e. HTTPS

An X.509 certificate contains a public key and an identity and is either signed by a Certificate Authority or self-signed

## Getting a signed certificate

An organization requests one via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

A CSR contains:

* public key
* identifying information
* integrity protection

First generate a key pair
keep the private key secret and use it to sign idenityfing information in the CSR

The Certificate Authority issues a certificate binding a public key to a distinguished name (the identifying information)
