# x509

Is a standard in cryptography which defines the format of public key certificates.
Used in TLS/SSL, i.e. HTTPS

An X.509 certificate contains a public key and an identity and is either signed by a Certificate Authority or self-signed

verifies that a public key belongs to the identity contained within the certificate

It is another layer of security on top of Public Key Cryptography to verify that the public key belongs to who you think it belongs to.

## what's in it?

* Version
  * of x.509
* Serial Number
  * assigned by identity creating certificate to distinguish it from other certificates
* Algorithm information
  * the algorithm used by the issuer to sign the certificate
* Issuer distinguished name
  * the name of the entity issuing the certificates
  * usually a CA (Certificate Authority)
* validity period of the certificate
  * start/end date & time
* subject distinguished name
  * the name of the identity the certificate is issued to
* subject public key information
  * the public key associated with the identity
* extensions

## Getting a signed certificate

An organization requests one via a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

A CSR contains:

* public key
* identifying information
* integrity protection

First generate a key pair
keep the private key secret and use it to sign idenityfing information in the CSR

The Certificate Authority issues a certificate binding a public key to a distinguished name (the identifying information)
