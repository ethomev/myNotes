## using it

psql command line tool to connect to a database instance

\?              list the possible commands
\c [DB_NAME]    connect to database
\q              quit the connection

It's SQL based, the syntax is very similar to what I'm used to in MYSQL

I'm sure there's some fancy stuff it can do but I'll leave that until I need it.

## Data types

String
Integer
Date Time
and many more ...
