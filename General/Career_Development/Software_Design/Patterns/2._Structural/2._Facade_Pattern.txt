====== 2. Facade Pattern ======
Created Thursday 16 March 2017

Create a new interface to "wrap" an existing API, or set of API's
This can be to simplify the API, adapt it to your needs, or control functionality.

Scenario:
	multiple method invocations on various classes to achieve a desired functionality.
	Desired functionality is required in multiple places.
	This will lead to code maintenance issues and tight coupling.
	
Multiple method invocations are encapsulated into a single method of the facade class
	Single point of contact and looser coupling
