# 5. Composite Pattern

GoF Definition: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly

## Implementation
Component	interface for objects in the composition
Leaf		objects in the composition which implement the component interface
Composite	implements component interface and is composed of multiple leafs


## My Thoughts
A scenario is made up of flows which can contain flows / test steps.
	the flow could be the composite and the leaf the test step

In the RxScenarios DataSourceStrategy is an example of a Composite
