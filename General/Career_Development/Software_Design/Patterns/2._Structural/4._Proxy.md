# 4. Proxy

GoF Definition: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Put an object between a client and the object it wants to interact with.
The proxy can do anything you want:
	delay instantiation of the object proxied
	ensure the proxied object is in the correct state
	audit trailing????
	control access to a resource
It separates control from logic
Proxy is similar to stub in RPC/CORBA
	all requests to it are forwarded over the network to the actual imple

## Implementation
Java provides a Proxy class and an interface, InvocationHandler
You have your own interface and implementation
Implement the interface and give it the object to proxy
Proxy.newProxyInstance(...)
	This method takes the interfaces which should be proxied and the invocationHandler
Then when any method is called on the object which is part of the interface the invocationhandler is called
The client is not aware of a proxy

The examples show it without using the Java API:
	You have your interface and implementation
	The proxy implements the interface and has an instance of it.
		Similar to Adaptor and Decorator
	Proxy is instantiated with some information to control the proxy
	In this implementation the client has to instantiate the proxy so it is aware of it

## Pros
Using the Proxy API provided by Java the client is not aware of the proxy
