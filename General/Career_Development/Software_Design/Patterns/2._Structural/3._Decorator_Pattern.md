###### 3. Decorator Pattern ######
Created Tuesday 21 March 2017

https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-decorator

GoF Definition: Allows for the dynamic wrapping of objects in order to modify their existing responsibilities & behaviour

"Decorate" the functionality of an existing implementation.
The decorator impl is an instance of the API and has an instance of the API.
This pattern can allow generic functionality and/or attributes to be applied to multiple implementations of an API.
Useful when some new functionality is required in an API in production.

Can also be used like a builder. An interface & a set of subclasses can be composed into one final object.
A property of the final object is spread throughout the subclasses and the decorate pattern allows the jvm to go through the chain and create the 
final property.

##### My Thoughts #####
When would I use this?
	Add generic behaviour to a set of classes which implement an interface
		Could logging of test step, flow & scenario start and finish messages be a Decorator?
			Probably over kill as there would be an instance of the Logger Test Step for every test step
	A core object that can have optional functionality which can be randomly combined.
		If there are multiple interfaces which different objects implement different combinations of them
