Created Thursday 20 April 2017

Change the behaviour of an object depending on it's internal state.

GoF Definition: Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.


==== Implementation ====
A State interface, which has a number of implementations.
Each implementation encapsulates all the behaviour associated with that particular state. / Implements it's own implementation for the request.
A Context class has an instance of state that changes.

This is quite similar to the Strategy pattern, except the change happens at runtime instead of the client deciding.

When to use:
	when the behaviour of an object should be influenced by it's state.
	complex conditions tie object behaviour to it's state.
