# 1. Template Method

https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-template-method

GoF Definition: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithms structure.

Defines a way to re-use algorithms for various impl's with different or slightly difference outcomes.
Works through inheritance.
There is an abstract base class, which has the methods of the algorithm left abstract.
Any common methods are implemented in the base class and made final, any specific are left abstract.

**Hollywood Principle: **Don't call us, we'll call you.
	Parent class calls methods of subclass when necessary.
	Avoids low level component depending on high level components
	
4 different types of methods in th parent class:
	Concrete methods:	complete methods which are common to and used by all specific algorithms.
	Abstract methods:	methods which are specific to each algorithm and should be implemted by said algorithm class
	Hook methods:		Default implementation which may be overridden in some sub classes
	Template methods:	A method which class any of the above methods listed above in order to describe the algorithm, the "main" for the algorithm I suppose.

CLIToolProvider in cli-tool is an example of the Template Pattern

##### When to use? #####
When there is an algorithm were certain parts are common and the rest are specific.
