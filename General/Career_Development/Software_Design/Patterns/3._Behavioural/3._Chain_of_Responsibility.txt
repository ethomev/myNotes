====== 3. Chain of Responsibility ======
Created Monday 03 April 2017

https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-uncovered-chain-of-responsibility

GoF Definition: Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking the receiving objects together.

They are linked in such a way that each object handles the request independently

Implementation:
	Interface which handles the request and allows to set next handler
	Implementations which implement the above interface and have an instance of a successor to handle the request.
	
An example would be exception handling, exception is "handled" by every class until it is dealt with or reaches the top of the stack
The example in the dzone article is rules in an email client. You have multiple rules, an email must be processed by all rules until it matches a rule or all rules have been processed.

===== My thoughts =====
Would an example be exception handling in scenarios???? Or listeners in scenarios
