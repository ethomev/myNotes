GoF Definition: Create objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning/copying

Utilized when creating an instance of a class is expensive/complicated.
	Involves copying something when it already exists.
	Instead of creating an object from scratch every time, make a copy of an original and modify as required.
	
Interface declares a method for cloning itself which the implementation implements.
Implementation has a constructor which takes an instance of itself which is called in the clone method.

OR

Base Abstract class which has a clone method.
Call this method through subclasses of the base classs

When to use?
	Composition, creation & representation of objects should be decoupled from the system?
	Classes to be created are specified at runtime?
	Hide complexity of creating new instances from clients.
	**Creating an object is expensive**
	Objects are required that are similar to existing objects.
	

===== My Thoughts =====
Is this like a Prototype in javascript?
	Javascript is a prototypical language
		a prototype for a class is created and all new instances are copied from this.
There is a Cloneable interface in Java
	It is recommended not to use it though
		apparently it's tricky to use
